# Privacy Policy


<br>

## App Analytics
We use App Store Connect, Google Firebase, and RevenueCat to help improve the app. Each provides us with anonymized and generic usage and/or transaction data that we use to inform our product decisions and understand how people are using GameTrack.

<br>

## What Personal Information we collect about you and how we collect it
When signing up for a GameTrack account, your full name is provided to us by Apple and set to your GameTrack account. If you choose to share your email address with us, this is also associated to your GameTrack account. If you upload a Profile picture, this is stored on Google Firebase (any subsequent Profile pictures uploaded will overwrite the previous). These are the only pieces of personal information we store.

<br>

## What rights do you, as the data subject, have
If you would like a copy of your personal data, or the deletion of your GameTrack account, please contact us at getgametrack@icloud.com.

<br>

## Changes to this policy
GameTrack may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. If we change our policy for any reason, we will update the 'Last updated' date at the top of this page.
